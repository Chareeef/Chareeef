# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Youssef

As a passionate Alx - Software Engineering student, I am on a mission to transform lives through the power of technology. Inspired by my own journey with cerebral palsy, I am driven to develop software solutions that empower individuals, particularly those with special needs, to thrive and find joy in their everyday experiences. I believe that by harnessing innovation and empathy, we can build a more inclusive world where everyone has the opportunity to flourish. Join me in making a difference, one line of code at a time.
