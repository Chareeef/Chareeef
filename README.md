# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Youssef


As an Alx - Software Engineering student, my aim is to make a meaningful impact by creating software that can assist humans with special needs with their daily activities. This aspiration stems from my own experiences as someone with cerebral palsy who understands the challenges faced daily by people with disabilities.
